An Appointment Management and Tracking System as well as Lab Reports from both ends.
Majority of hospitals in rural areas and towns or even in some cities don't have their own website and do not provide with services like online appointment booking.

Despite of an increase in number of smart phone users in India in last few years, patients have to wait in queues in clinics simply because the digital growth is not channelized.

Keeping this in mind, we have come with a project called 'Medicare' that aims at digitalization of small hospitals and clinics.
